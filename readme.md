Thier are two versions of the project in the repository.

Project2orginal is what I worked on for the two weeks. This one doesn't count the lines right and produces to many lines. It also doesn't split the file by month or find the lowest requested file.

Project2reworks uses the parcer from the example code and counts correctly. I worked in the code that I wrote in to it where possible. The things that are used from the example is the parcer, the files requesed counter, and log splitter.
